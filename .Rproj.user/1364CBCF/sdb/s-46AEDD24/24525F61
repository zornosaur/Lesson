Spatial Statistics uses distance, area, orientation or any other spacial relationships to analyze, predict, or model datasets where space is involved.\n\nThe concept of Spatial Statistics seems to have origins in cartography but throughout the year has contributed to botany (plants), ecology (environment), ethology (animal movement), epidemiology (disease), and economics. Today, it is most commonly used for the analysis of geographic data.\n\nSpatial statistics is unique from analytic methods commonly studied in an undergraduate-level statistics course. The differences can be seen  by the sheer number of difference in fundamental approach, forms of data, and  fields of applicable research.\n\n### Objectives\n\nIntroduce this area of statistics to calss, give them exposure.\n\nBe familiar to applciations of the package.\n\nTalk briefly about other packages.\n\nShow how this is applicable to being an analyst in the air force.\n\n### Example\n\nOne of the most important application of spatial analysis in wildlife tracking is home range estimation. Many mammals restrict their movements to a home range, rarely venturing far. By estimating an animals home range we can investigate what events effect the home range, and how it changes based on time. \n\nFor example see how these home ranges change from April to May to June.\n\n```{r include =FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr);\nlibrary(adehabitatHR);\n```\n\n```{r echo = F}\ntrack = read.csv(\"DeerSample.csv\")\ntrack = na.omit(track)\n\ntrack2 = filter(track, DATETIME >= 40634 & DATETIME <= 40663) #april\ntrack3 = filter(track, DATETIME >= 40664 & DATETIME <= 40694) #may\ntrack4 = filter(track, DATETIME >= 40695 & DATETIME <= 40724) #june\n\ntrack2S = SpatialPoints(data.frame(track2$LONGITUDE, track2$LATITUDE))\ntrack3S = SpatialPoints(data.frame(track3$LONGITUDE, track3$LATITUDE))\ntrack4S = SpatialPoints(data.frame(track4$LONGITUDE, track4$LATITUDE))\n\ntrack2K = kernelUD(track2S)\ntrack3K = kernelUD(track3S)\ntrack4K = kernelUD(track4S)\n\ntrack2H = getverticeshr(track2K)\ntrack3H = getverticeshr(track3K)\ntrack4H = getverticeshr(track4K)\n\nplot(track2H,col = 2)\nplot(track3H,col = 3, add = T)\nplot(track4H,col = 4, add = T)\n\nlegend(\"topright\", title=\"Months\", c(\"April\",\"May\",\"June\"), fill=c(2,3,4), horiz=F)\n\ntitle(main = \"Figure 1. Home ranges for a single female \\n deer in 3 different months\")\n```\n\nThe home range varies so much because female deer give birth in late May or early June.The deer is very active in April because she is eating for two, she moves aorund a lot to find sufficient nourishment. This deer most likely gave birth in late may, which is why the home range is smaller, but not as small as in June. In June the deer has given birth to a new fawn, which limits its movements.\n\nSome methods for calculating home ranges calculates them based off a percentile. One such method is the minimum convex polygon. This method creates the smallest possible convex home range which includes all the points in a certain percentile. \n\n```{r echo = F}\ntrack1 = filter(track, DATETIME >= 40603 & DATETIME <= 40633)\ntrackSp = SpatialPoints(data.frame(track$LONGITUDE, track$LATITUDE))\n\ntrackCp = mcp(trackSp, percent = 99)\ntrack90C = mcp(trackSp, percent = 90)\ntrack80C = mcp(trackSp, percent = 80)\ntrack70C = mcp(trackSp, percent = 70)\ntrack60C = mcp(trackSp, percent = 60)\ntrack50C = mcp(trackSp, percent = 50)\n\nplot(trackCp)\nplot(track90C, add = T, col = 2)\nplot(track80C, add = T, col = 3)\nplot(track70C, add = T, col = 4)\nplot(track60C, add = T, col = 5)\nplot(track50C, add = T, col = 6)\nplot(trackSp, add = T)\n```\n\n### Readings\n\nMaterials for the students to review before class, and use as references while doing the homework.\n\nAn brief article which addresses the importance of spatial analysis in the world.
